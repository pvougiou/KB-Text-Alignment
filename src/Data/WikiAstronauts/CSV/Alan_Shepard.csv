"	In January 1961, <b><font color=""purple"">Shepard</font></b> was chosen for the first American manned mission into space.	"
"	Although the flight was originally scheduled for October 1960, delays by unplanned preparatory work meant that this was postponed several times, initially to March 6, 1961, and finally to May 5.	"
"	On <b><font color=""purple"">April</font></b> 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin had become <b><font color=""purple"">the first person</font></b> in space and to orbit <b><font color=""purple"">the Earth</font></b>.	"

"	<b><font color=""purple"">He</font></b> was launched by a Redstone rocket, and unlike Gagarin's 108-minute orbital flight, <b><font color=""purple"">Shepard</font></b> stayed on a ballistic trajectorya 15-minute suborbital flight which carried him to an altitude of 116 statute miles (187km) and to a splashdown point 302 statute miles (486km) down the Atlantic Missile Range.	"
"	Unlike Gagarin, whose flight was strictly automatic, <b><font color=""purple"">Shepard</font></b> had some control of <b><font color=""purple"">Freedom 7</font></b>, spacecraft attitude in particular.	"
	The launch was seen live on television by millions.	
"	Shortly before the launch, <b><font color=""purple"">Shepard</font></b> said to himself: ""Don't fuck up, Shepard..."" According to Gene Kranz in his book, Failure Is Not an Option, ""When reporters asked <b><font color=""purple"">Shepard</font></b> what he thought about as he sat atop the Redstone rocket, waiting for liftoff, he had replied, 'The fact that every part of this ship was built by the low bidder.'""	"
"	After a dramatic Atlantic Ocean recovery, Commander <b><font color=""purple"">Shepard</font></b> observed, ""didn't really feel the flight was a success until the recovery had been successfully completed.	"

"	After the Mercury-Atlas 10 <b><font color=""purple"">mission</font></b> was cancelled, <b><font color=""purple"">Shepard</font></b> was designated as <b><font color=""purple"">the command pilot</font></b> of the first manned Project Gemini <b><font color=""purple"">mission</font></b>.	"
	Thomas P. Stafford was chosen as his co-pilot.	
"	In early 1964, <b><font color=""purple"">Shepard</font></b> was diagnosed with <b><font color=""purple"">Mnire</font></b>'s <b><font color=""purple"">disease</font></b>, a condition in which fluid pressure builds up in the inner ear.	"
"	This syndrome causes the semicircular canals and motion detectors to become extremely sensitive, resulting in disorientation, dizziness, and nausea.	"
"	The condition caused him to be removed from flight status for most of the 1960s (<b><font color=""purple"">Gus Grissom</font></b> and <b><font color=""purple"">John Young</font></b> were assigned to <b><font color=""purple"">Gemini 3</font></b> instead).	"
"	Also in 1963, he was designated <b><font color=""purple"">Chief of the Astronaut Office</font></b>, with responsibility for monitoring the coordination, scheduling, and control of all activities involving <b><font color=""purple"">NASA</font></b> <b><font color=""purple"">astronauts</font></b>.	"
"	This included monitoring the development and implementation of effective training programs to assure the flight readiness of personnel for crew assignments on manned space flights; furnishing pilot evaluations applicable to the design, construction, and operations of spacecraft systems and related equipment; and providing qualitative scientific and engineering observations to facilitate overall mission planning, formulation of feasible operational procedures, and selection and conduct of specific experiments for each flight.

"	<b><font color=""purple"">He</font></b> was originally assigned to command <b><font color=""purple"">Apollo 13</font></b>, but as it was felt he needed more time to train, he and his crewmates (lunar module pilot <b><font color=""purple"">Edgar Mitchell</font></b> and <b><font color=""purple"">command module pilot</font></b> <b><font color=""purple"">Stuart Roosa</font></b>) swapped <b><font color=""purple"">missions</font></b> with the then crew of <b><font color=""purple"">Apollo 14</font></b> (<b><font color=""purple"">James Lovell</font></b>, <b><font color=""purple"">Ken Mattingly</font></b>, and <b><font color=""purple"">Fred Haise</font></b>).	"
"	As the oldest <b><font color=""purple"">astronaut</font></b> in the program at age 47, <b><font color=""purple"">Shepard</font></b> made his second space flight as commander of <b><font color=""purple"">Apollo 14</font></b> from January 31  February 9, 1971, <b><font color=""purple"">America</font></b>'s third successful lunar landing mission.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">Shepard</font></b> piloted the Lunar Module Antares to the most accurate landing of the entire Apollo program.	"
"	This was the first mission to successfully broadcast color television pictures from the surface of the Moon, using a vidicon tube camera.	"
"	(The color camera on Apollo 12 provided a few brief moments of color telecasting before it was inadvertently pointed at the Sun, ending its usefulness.)	"
"	While on the Moon, <b><font color=""purple"">Shepard</font></b> used a Wilson six-iron head attached to a lunar sample scoop handle to drive golf balls.	"
"	Despite thick gloves and a stiff spacesuit which forced him to swing the club with one hand, <b><font color=""purple"">Shepard</font></b> struck two golf balls; driving the second, as he jokingly put it, ""miles and miles and miles.""	"
"	Following <b><font color=""purple"">Apollo 14</font></b>, <b><font color=""purple"">Shepard</font></b> returned to his position as <b><font color=""purple"">Chief</font></b> of the Astronaut Office in June 1971.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">He</font></b> was appointed by President Richard Nixon in July 1971 as a delegate to the 26th United Nations General Assembly, serving from September to December 1971.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">He</font></b> was promoted to Rear Admiral by <b><font color=""purple"">Nixon</font></b> that same year before retiring both from the <b><font color=""purple"">Navy</font></b> and NASA on August 1, 1974.	"
"	After <b><font color=""purple"">Shepard</font></b> left <b><font color=""purple"">NASA</font></b>, he served on the boards of many corporations.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">He</font></b> also served as president of his umbrella company for several business enterprises, Seven Fourteen Enterprises, Inc. (named for his two flights, <b><font color=""purple"">Freedom 7</font></b> and <b><font color=""purple"">Apollo 14</font></b>).	"
"	In 1994, he published <b><font color=""purple"">a book</font></b> with two journalists, <b><font color=""purple"">Jay Barbree</font></b> and Howard Benedict, called <b><font color=""purple"">Moon Shot</font></b>: The Inside Story of <b><font color=""purple"">America</font></b>'s Race to the Moon.	"
"	Fellow Mercury <b><font color=""purple"">astronaut</font></b> <b><font color=""purple"">Deke Slayton</font></b> is also named as an author.	"
"	The book generated some controversy for use of a staged photo purportedly showing <b><font color=""purple"">Shepard</font></b> hitting a golf ball on the Moon.	"
	The book was also turned into a TV miniseries in 1994.	
"	<b><font color=""purple"">Shepard</font></b> died of <b><font color=""purple"">leukemia</font></b> near his home in <b><font color=""purple"">Pebble Beach</font></b>, <b><font color=""purple"">California</font></b>, on July 21, 1998 (the 29th anniversary of the first moonwalk), two years after being diagnosed with <b><font color=""purple"">that disease</font></b>.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">He</font></b> was the second <b><font color=""purple"">person</font></b> to die who had walked on the Moon.	"
