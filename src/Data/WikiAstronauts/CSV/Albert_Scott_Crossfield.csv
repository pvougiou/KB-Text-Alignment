Sentence
"	<b><font color=""purple"">Albert <b><font color=""purple"">Scott</font></b> Crossfield</font></b> (October 2, 1921  April 19, 2006) was an <b><font color=""purple"">American naval</font></b> officer and <b><font color=""purple"">test</font></b> pilot.	"
"	Born in Berkeley, California, <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> grew up in California and Washington.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">He</font></b> served with <b><font color=""purple"">the U.S. Navy</font></b> as a flight instructor and fighter pilot during World War II.	"
"	From 1946 to 1950, he worked in the University of <b><font color=""purple"">Washington</font></b>'s <b><font color=""purple"">Kirsten</font></b> Wind Tunnel while earning his bachelor's (1949) and master's degrees (1950) in aeronautical engineering.	"
"	In 1950, <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> joined the <b><font color=""purple"">National</font></b> Advisory Committee for Aeronautics' (<b><font color=""purple"">NACA</font></b>) High-Speed Flight Station (now the <b><font color=""purple"">NASA</font></b> Dryden Flight Research Center) at Edwards Air Force Base, <b><font color=""purple"">California</font></b>, as an aeronautical research pilot.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> demonstrated his flight test skills on his very first student solo.	"
"	His instructor was not available on the designated early morning, so Crossfield, on his own, took off and went through maneuvers he had practiced with his instructor, including spin entry and spin recovery.	"
"	During the first spin, <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> experienced vibrations, banging, and noise in the aircraft that he had never encountered with his instructor.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">He</font></b> recovered, climbed to a higher altitude, and repeated his spin entry and spin recovery, getting the same vibration, banging and noise.	"
"	On his third spin entry, at yet an even higher altitude, he looked over his shoulder as he was spinning and observed the instructor's door disengaged and flapping in the spin.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">He</font></b> reached back, pulled the door closed, and discovered all the vibrations, banging and noise stopped.	"
"	Satisfied, he recovered from the spin, landed (actually, did several landings), and fueled the airplane.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">He</font></b> also realized his instructor had been holding the door during their practice spin entries and recoveries, and never mentioned this door quirk.	"
"	In later years, <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> often cited his curiosity about this solo spin anomaly and his desire to analyze what was going on and why it happened, as the start of his <b><font color=""purple"">test pilot</font></b> career.	"
"	Over the next five years, he flew nearly all of the experimental aircraft under test at Edwards, including the X-1, XF-92, X-4, X-5, <b><font color=""purple"">Douglas</font></b> <b><font color=""purple"">D-558-I Skystreak</font></b> and the <b><font color=""purple"">Douglas</font></b> D-558-II Skyrocket.	"
"	During one of his X-1 flights, the cockpit windows completely frosted and <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> was literally flying blind.	"
"	Ever resourceful, he removed a loafer, took off his sock, and created a peep hole to reference his chase plane wingman all the way to landing.	"
"	On November 20, 1953, he became <b><font color=""purple"">the first person</font></b> to fly at twice the speed of sound as he piloted the Skyrocket to a speed of 1,291mph (2,078km/h, Mach 2.005).	"
	The Skyrocket D-558-II surpassed its intended design speed by 25 percent on that day.	
"	With 99 flights in the rocket-powered X-1 and D-558-II, <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> had  by a wide margin  more experience with rocketplanes than any other pilot in the world by the time he left Edwards to join North American Aviation in 1955.	"
"	In September 1954, <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> was forced to make a dead stick landing in <b><font color=""purple"">the <b><font color=""purple"">North American</font></b> F-100 Super Sabre</font></b> he was evaluating at Dryden, a feat which <b><font color=""purple"">North American</font></b>'s own test pilots doubted could be done, as <b><font color=""purple"">the F-100</font></b> had a high landing speed.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> made a perfect approach and touchdown, but was unable to bring the unpowered aircraft to a halt in a safe distance, and was forced to use the wall of the NACA hangar as a makeshift brake after narrowly missing several parked experimental aircraft (""with great precision,"" as he later wryly joked).	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> was uninjured, and the F-100 was later repaired and returned to service.	"
"	As chief engineering <b><font color=""purple"">test pilot</font></b> for North American, <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> played a major role in the design and development of the North American X-15 and its systems.	"
"	Once it was ready to fly, it was his job to demonstrate its airworthiness at speeds ranging up to Mach 3 (2,290mph).	"
"	Because the X-15 and its systems were unproven, these tests were considered extremely hazardous.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> flew 14 of the 199 total X-15 flight tests with most of these tests establishing and validating initial key parameters.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> not only designed the X-15 from the beginning, but introduced many innovations, including putting engine controls of the rocket plane into the cockpit.	"
"	Previously, all engine adjustments resulted from technicians making adjustments on the ground based upon results of flight profiles.	"
"	It was during this time that <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> was part of the <b><font color=""purple"">U.S.</font></b> Air Force's Man In Space Soonest project.	"
"	On June 8, 1959, he completed the airplane's first flight, an unpowered glide from 37,550 feet.	"
"	On September 17, 1959, he completed the first powered flight.	"
"	Because of delays in the development of the X-15's mammoth 57,000 pounds force (254kN) thrust <b><font color=""purple"">XLR-99</font></b> engine, the early flights were completed with a pair of interim <b><font color=""purple"">XLR-11</font></b> rocket engines.	"
"	Shortly after launch on his third flight, one of these engines exploded.	"
"	Unable to jettison his propellants, <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> was forced to make an emergency landing during which the excessive load on the aircraft broke its back just behind the cockpit.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">He</font></b> was uninjured and the airplane was repaired.	"
"	On June 8, 1960, he had another close call during ground tests with the XLR-99 engine.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">He</font></b> was seated in the cockpit of the No. 3 X-15 when a malfunctioning valve caused a catastrophic explosion.	"
"	Remarkably, he was once again uninjured and the airplane was completely rebuilt.	"
"	On November 15 of the same year, he completed the X-15's first powered flight with the XLR-99 engine.	"
"	Two flights later, on December 6, he brought <b><font color=""purple"">North American</font></b>'s demonstration program to a successful conclusion as he completed his final flight in <b><font color=""purple"">the X-15</font></b>.	"
"	Although it had been his hope to eventually pilot one of the craft into space, the USAF would not allow it, and gave strict orders which basically amounted to ""stay in the sky, stay out of space.""	"
"	All together, he completed 16 captive flights (mated to the B-52 launch aircraft), one glide and 13 powered flights in the X-15.	"
"	The surprise retirement of the X-15 (due to funding cutbacks) after its record-setting Mach 6.72 (4,520mph) flight prompted pilot Pete Knight to remark that he would have pushed it to even faster speeds if he knew it was the last flight.	"
"	In his remarks to a number of aviation groups, <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> cited the X-15 as one of few aircraft that caused grown men to cry upon its retirement.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">He</font></b> remained at <b><font color=""purple"">North American</font></b> as systems director of test and quality assurance in the <b><font color=""purple"">company</font></b>'s <b><font color=""purple"">Space</font></b> and Information Systems Division where he oversaw quality, reliability engineering and systems test activities for such programs as the Apollo command and service modules and the <b><font color=""purple"">Saturn II</font></b> <b><font color=""purple"">booster</font></b>.	"
"	In 1966, he became the division's technical director for research engineering and test.	"
"	In 1961, A. <b><font color=""purple"">Scott</font></b> Crossfied became division director of test and quality assurance for NAA's Paraglider project.	"
"	In 1967, <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> joined Eastern Air Lines where he served as a division vice president for research and development and, subsequently, as a staff vice president working with <b><font color=""purple"">U.S.</font></b> military and civilian agencies on air traffic control technologies.	"
"	In 1974-1975, he worked for Hawker Siddeley as a senior vice president supporting HS 146 activities in <b><font color=""purple"">the United States</font></b>.	"
"	In 1977, he joined <b><font color=""purple"">the United States House</font></b> of <b><font color=""purple"">Representatives</font></b> <b><font color=""purple"">Committee</font></b> on Science and Technology where he served, until his retirement in 1993, as a technical adviser on all aspects of civil aviation research and development and became one of the <b><font color=""purple"">nation</font></b>'s leading advocates for a reinvigorated research airplane program.	"
"	In a 2000 public lecture, 'Scotty' (as he was known to friends) described how the X-15 aeronautical calculations and design required computing power that filled four 10'x12' rooms.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">He</font></b> went on to say that these very same calculations could be performed today on a notebook computer.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">He</font></b> also hinted that <b><font color=""purple"">Burt Rutan</font></b> and his <b><font color=""purple"">Scaled</font></b> Composite <b><font color=""purple"">company</font></b> were performing pioneering work for a private aircraft to take-off from an airport, fly into outer space, and return to that airport.	"
"	In 2004, White Knight carried Space Ship One to its successful launch and winning of the Ansari X-Prize, the first attempt by a plane since the X-15 cancellation.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> was played by <b><font color=""purple"">Scott</font></b> Wilson in the 1983 film The Right Stuff.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> co-authored Always Another Dawn, a story of a rocket <b><font color=""purple"">test pilot</font></b>, with Clay Blair Jr, and authored ""Onward and Upward"" Research Airplanes, Act II.	"
"	In <b><font color=""purple"">1986</font></b> he created and funded the A. <b><font color=""purple"">Scott</font></b> <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> Aerospace <b><font color=""purple"">Education</font></b> <b><font color=""purple"">Teacher</font></b> of the <b><font color=""purple"">Year</font></b> Award presented annually under the stewardship of the Civil Air Patrol during the National Congress on Aerospace <b><font color=""purple"">Education</font></b> now called the National Conference on Aerospace <b><font color=""purple"">Education</font></b> (NCASE).	"
"	After his death in 2006 and the shift of NCASE from an annual to biannual conference, Crossfields's daughter, Sally <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> Farley, moved the award to the National Aviation Hall of Fame and it is now presented during the Enshrinement Weekend each July in Dayton, Ohio.	"
"	From 2001 to 2003, <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> trained pilots Terry Queijo, Kevin Kochersberger, Chris Johnson and Ken Hyde for The <b><font color=""purple"">Wright</font></b> Experience, which prepared to fly a reproduction <b><font color=""purple"">Wright</font></b> Flyer on the 100th anniversary of the <b><font color=""purple"">Wright</font></b> Brothers' first flight on December 17, 1903.	"
"	The training was successful, but the re-creation of the flight on December 17, 2003 was ultimately not successful due to low engine power and the flyer's rain-soaked fabric covering which added considerably to its takeoff weight.	"
	The Wright replica did fly successfully at Kitty Hawk after the Centennial jubilee but without media coverage.	
"	In one sense, it was only fitting that <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> conducted this experimental flight training because all pilots in this project had to unlearn their considerable flying experience and learn forgotten Wright brothers techniques.	"
"	When asked to name his favorite airplane, <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> replied, ""the one I was flying at the time,"" because he thoroughly enjoyed them all and their unique personalities.	"
"	To young teens, he would compare airplanes to different girls or boys they would date: each one was special and a learning experience.	"
"	On April 19, 2006, a Cessna 210A piloted by <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> was reported missing while flying from Prattville, Alabama toward Manassas, Virginia.	"
"	On April 20, authorities confirmed his body was found in the wreckage of his plane in a remote area of Ludville, Georgia.	"
	There were severe thunderstorms in the area when air traffic monitors lost radio and radar contact with Crossfield's plane.	
"	While lightning itself poses a relatively minor risk to all-metal aircraft like Crossfield's, thunderstorms often contain turbulence severe enough to break an aircraft into pieces, as well as strong downdrafts, heavy rain, severe icing, and heavy hail.	"
"	The Gordon County Sheriff's department reported that debris from Crossfield's aircraft was found in three different locations within a quarter mile, suggesting that the plane broke up while it was still in the air.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> was returning from <b><font color=""purple"">Maxwell Air Force Base</font></b>, <b><font color=""purple"">Montgomery</font></b>, <b><font color=""purple"">Alabama</font></b>, where he had given a speech to a class of young Air Force officers attending the Air and Space Basic Course.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">He</font></b> was survived by his wife of sixty-three years, Alice Crossfield, six children and nine grandchildren.	"
"	His funeral ceremony was held at the Arlington National Cemetery on August 15, 2006.	"
"	On September 27, 2007, the National Transportation Safety Board issued a report stating the probable cause of his crash to be as follows: ""The pilot's failure to obtain updated en route <b><font color=""purple"">weather</font></b> information, which resulted in his continued instrument flight into a widespread area of severe convective activity, and the air traffic controller's failure to provide adverse <b><font color=""purple"">weather</font></b> avoidance assistance, as required by Federal Aviation Administration directives, both of which led to the airplane's encounter with a severe thunderstorm and subsequent loss of control.""	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> received the Lawrence Sperry Award (1954), Octave Chanute Award (1954), Iven C. Kincheloe Award (<b><font color=""purple"">1960</font></b>), American Rocket Society (ARS) Astronautics Award (<b><font color=""purple"">1960</font></b>), Harmon International Trophy (1961 at the White House by <b><font color=""purple"">President John F. Kennedy</font></b>), Collier Trophy (1961 at the White House by <b><font color=""purple"">President Kennedy</font></b> in 1962), NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal (1993), and was named Honorary Fellow by <b><font color=""purple"">the American Institute</font></b> of Aeronautics and Astronautics (<b><font color=""purple"">AIAA</font></b>) (1999).	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> is the only American to be honored in the White House for his contributions in advancing aeronautical science - or any other discipline - more than once, let alone two consecutive years.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">He</font></b> has been inducted into the <b><font color=""purple"">National</font></b> Aviation Hall of Fame (1983), the International Space Hall of Fame (1988), the <b><font color=""purple"">Virginia</font></b> Aviation Hall of Fame (1998), Aerospace Walk of <b><font color=""purple"">Honor</font></b> (1990), The Glen A. Gilbert Memorial Award (1990) and the <b><font color=""purple"">National</font></b> Air and Space Museum Trophy (2000).	"
"	Posthumously, he has been awarded the Hoyt S. Vandenberg Award, the Paul Tissandier Diploma, the Victor A. Prather Award, and the Donald D. Engen Award.	"
"	An elementary school was named in his honor near his last residence, in Herndon, Virginia (a community just northeast of Dulles International Airport).	"
	A ribbon named after him is one of the Aerospace Education Awards in the Civil Air Patrol Senior Members program.	
"	The terminal at the Chehalis-Centralia Airport (<b><font color=""purple"">CLS</font></b>) in Washington <b><font color=""purple"">state</font></b> bears his name.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">He</font></b> was also most proud of his A. <b><font color=""purple"">Scott</font></b> <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> Aerospace <b><font color=""purple"">Education</font></b> <b><font color=""purple"">Teacher</font></b> of the Year Award which is awarded annually at what is known as the ""Oscar Night"" in aviation, the Annual Enshrinement Ceremony Weekend at the National Aviation Hall of Fame held each year at the end of July in Dayton, Ohio.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> received an honorary doctor of science degree from the Florida Institute of Technology in 1982.	"
"	While he was celebrated as a daring <b><font color=""purple"">test pilot</font></b>, he claimed that his actual profession was an engineer.	"
"	""I am an aeronautical engineer, an aerodynamicist and a designer.	"
"	My flying was only primarily because I felt that it was essential to designing and building better airplanes for pilots to fly.""	"
"	Even so, <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> often performed much of the dangerous initial <b><font color=""purple"">test</font></b> flight profiles with a small cadre of other <b><font color=""purple"">test</font></b> pilots before active duty Air Force and Navy <b><font color=""purple"">test</font></b> pilots were turned loose in the experimental aircraft.	"
"	<b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> opined his military, NACA/NASA, and manufacturer flight test jobs were to prepare military <b><font color=""purple"">test pilots</font></b> for the tasks in which they earned recognition for aeronautical firsts by giving them solid flight data.	"
"	To friends and protgs, <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> was incredibly generous with his time and his insights.	"
	A morning meet for a cup of coffee could easily turn into a three-hour chat about almost anything.	
	One such chat was about his first meeting with Vice President Nixon and his test flight; Nixon remarked about the danger of flying.	
"	<b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> replied, ""I think you are in a much more precarious position, sir, as an elected official"", then wryly remarked that he predicted Watergate fallout well before <b><font color=""purple"">any other person</font></b>.	"
"	To an even smaller group of those who were close, <b><font color=""purple"">Crossfield</font></b> discussed distinguishing capabilities of <b><font color=""purple"">test pilots</font></b> and who could be counted upon to get recurring reliable data on profile flights and those who were assigned to the chase planes.
